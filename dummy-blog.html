   Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the
   visual impression of different typefaces Dummy text is text that is used
   in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which
   will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for
   example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known
   as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy
   texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made'
   text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by
   typesetters since the 16th century.

 <h2>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>
 <p>
   Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different
   typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of dummy text is
   nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts,
   non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to
   recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution
   of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from
   making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and readability of the
   typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout
   or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or
   less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive
   patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates
   the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous
   when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout
   impression of the final publication is not compromised.

 <h2>
   Incomprehensibility or readability? <small>That is the question.</small>
 </h2>
 <p>
   The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to
   have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a
   pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin.
   It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is
   also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European
   languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the
   relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not
   attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the
   layout.
